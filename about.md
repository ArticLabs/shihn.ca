👋🏽 I'm Preet - A Canadian 🇨🇦 engineer, living in San Francisco.

I studied Computer Engineering 💻 and Physics ⚛️ at University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada.

I've been professionally writing code for a while - worked on UI automation engines, web browsers, control systems, a few other random things. 
For the last few years though, I have been developing mostly for the web.
