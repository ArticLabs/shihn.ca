[wired-elements](https://wiredjs.com/) are a set of common UI elements with a hand-drawn, sketchy look. These can be used for wireframes, mockups, or just the fun hand-drawn look.

Wired Elements are implemented as web components, and can be used on any page and with most frameworks.

The elements are drawn with enough randomness that no two renderings will be exactly the same â€” just like two separate hand-drawn shapes.
