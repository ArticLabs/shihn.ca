[math-ml](https://github.com/pshihn/math-ml) is a small-ish (compared to alternatives ~ 12kb gzipped) JavaScript implementation of [MathML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/MathML) using custom-elements. 

MathML has been part of part of the HTML5 spec for some time now, but many browsers don't support it (Chrome, for example). This is a simple attempt to use basic javascript, CSS and some SVG to implement MathML compatible notation that works across all browsers. _(All rendering is done on the client side)._
