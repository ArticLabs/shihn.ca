I'm happy to announce the 2.0 release of [wired-elements](https://wiredjs.com/). It started of, and still is, a fun project to work on. In this era of really slick and buttery smooth design systems, a brutal and rough beacon of light ðŸ˜‰

In this release, the underlying base code for all components was refactored to create smaller and more efficient components. By more efficient, I mean fewer re-renders of the sketchy shapes. This was done mainly by not re-rendering shapes if the dimensions do not change, and also by utilizing the [Resize Observer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ResizeObserver) where it's available.

View all components in action in the [wired-elements showcase](https://wiredjs.com/showcase.html).

New components in 2.0 ðŸ‘‡

## wired-calendar

This is the first fully community contributed component. [Eduardo Martinez](https://github.com/elingerojo) created this. The calendar is customizable in many ways, for details check out the [wired-calendar readme](https://github.com/wiredjs/wired-elements/tree/master/packages/wired-calendar).
